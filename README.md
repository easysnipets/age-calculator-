# Age Calculator

This is a simple web-based age calculator that allows users to calculate their age based on their birth date. The project consists of an HTML file for the structure, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file for the logic.

## Files

### `index.html`
The main HTML file that structures the age calculator. It includes a date input field, a button to trigger the calculation, and a paragraph to display the result.

### `style.css`
The CSS file that styles the age calculator. It uses Google Fonts for typography and includes styles for the container, input box, button, and result display.

### `script.js`
The JavaScript file that contains the logic for calculating the age. It takes the user's birth date, compares it with the current date, and calculates the age in years, months, and days.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter your birth date in the date input field.
3. Click the "Calculate" button.
4. The result will be displayed below the button, showing your age in years, months, and days.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The calculator is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- **Date Validation**: The date input field restricts users from selecting a date in the future.
- **Dynamic Calculation**: The age is calculated dynamically based on the current date.

## Customization

- **Styling**: You can customize the appearance of the calculator by modifying the `style.css` file.
- **Functionality**: You can extend or modify the age calculation logic in the `script.js` file.

## Dependencies

- **Google Fonts**: The project uses the "Poppins" font from Google Fonts for typography.
